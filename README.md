# "Exploratory Data Analysis" on dataset "Global Terrorism"

## Problem statement
- As a security/defense analyst, try to find out hot zone of terrorism.

- What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

## Introduction

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on domestic and international terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2019, and now includes more than 200,000 cases. For each event, information is available on the date and location of the incident, the weapons used and nature of the target, the number of casualties, and–when identifiable–the group or individual responsible.

The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) makes the GTD available via this online interface in an effort to increase understanding of terrorist violence so that it can be more readily studied and defeated.

Characteristics of the GTD

- Contains information on over 200,000 terrorist attacks
- Currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist attacks in the world
- Includes information on more than 95,000 bombings, 20,000 assassinations, and 15,000 kidnappings and hostage events since 1970
- Includes information on at least 45 variables for each case, with more recent incidents including information on more than 120 variables
- More than 4,000,000 news articles and 25,000 news sources were reviewed to collect incident data from 1998 to 2019 alone

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data. Data Scientists and Analysts try to find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques.

Following things are part of EDA :

1. Get maximum insights from a data set
2. Uncover underlying structure
3. Extract important variables from the dataset
4. Detect outliers and anomalies(if any)
5. Test underlying assumptions
6. Determine the optimal factor settings
